        <p><span class="p-start">Hi!</span> It is nice to meet you! I am Cyana, or otherwise known as CEa_TIde. I go at the moment by she/her pronouns.</p>
        <p>I currently study Computer Science in the Netherlands, the place I have been born and raised. 
            A dream of mine is to become an indie game dev, but who knows what the future holds!</p>
        <p>As you might have noticed, I also enjoy creating art, be that traditional art or digital. Almost every art piece on this website is made by yours truly! 
            Other hobbies include field hockey, reading manga, and of course playing games. Speaking of games, I create Minecraft builds as a freelancer. 
            My portfolio can be found <a href="/portfolio" class="slide-hover" title="Minecraft Portfolio">here</a>, if you are interested. See below how to contact me.</p>

        <p>Looking to contact me for a commission, to discuss my advice, or for other reasons? I am reachable via Discord or e-mail. Contact me via the way you prefer.</p>
        <p><span class="p-start">Discord:</span> My Discord username is <em>ceatide</em>. I don't accept friend requests but my DMs are open if you share a common server. 
            I am most active in the official Minecraft Discord server&mdash;which I also help moderate&mdash;, but you can also find me in numerous other Minecraft build servers.</p>
