        <p><span>Hi!</span> It is nice to meet you! I am Cyana, or otherwise known as CEa_TIde. I am transgender and go at the moment by she/her pronouns.</p>
        <p>I currently study Computer Science in the Netherlands, the place I have been born and raised. 
            A dream of mine is to become an indie game dev, but who knows what the future holds!</p>
